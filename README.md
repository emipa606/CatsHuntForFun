# CatsHuntForFun

Cats will hunt for fun, not just when they are hungry.

Adds a new activity for cats to hunt when not doing anything else.
The hunting attack is always a surprise attack so the risk for the cat to get hurt is minimal.
Cats will not try to hunt when hurt or downed.
They will also not attack until the prey is downed or killed but can choose to just hit it once and walk away. (Cats are like that)

There are options in the mod for
- Range to search for prey in
- How likely it is that a cat will attack a prey in range
- Relative body-size to attack
- Hunt only in home area
- To not hunt animals belonging to the player colony
- If wild animals should hunt for fun as well (they will ignore the above limitations regarding area and colony animals)

What animals are considered "Cats" can be selected as well.
There is built in support for some common cat-mods but if anyone is missing you can add it as well.

Or go nuts and enable it for wild thrumbos and try to survive!
